# Rate Limit Fix - 429 Too Many Requests Error

## 🚨 Problem Identified

You're getting **429 Too Many Requests** errors because the security enhancements I implemented included very strict rate limiting that was too restrictive for normal development and testing.

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

**Multiple Rate Limiting Systems Running Simultaneously:**

1. **General API Rate Limit**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
2. **Auth Rate Limit**: 5 requests per 15 minutes  
3. **CAPTCHA Rate Limit**: 20 requests per 15 minutes
4. **File Upload Rate Limit**: 10 files per hour

**These limits were too low for:**
- Development and testing
- Normal user interactions
- API calls from frontend
- File uploads and CAPTCHA generation

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Adjusted General API Rate Limits**

**Development Mode (`server/index.ts`):**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 100 requests/15min
// AFTER: 1000 requests/15min + dev bypass
const generalLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 1000, // Increased from 100
  skip: (req) => process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', // Dev bypass
});
```

**Production Mode (`server/index.prod.ts`):**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 100 requests/15min
// AFTER: 500 requests/15min
const generalLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 500, // Increased from 100
});
```

### 2. **Adjusted Auth Rate Limits**

**Development Mode:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 5 requests/15min
// AFTER: 20 requests/15min + dev bypass
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 20, // Increased from 5
  skip: (req) => process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', // Dev bypass
});
```

**Production Mode:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 5 requests/15min
// AFTER: 15 requests/15min
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 15, // Increased from 5
});
```

### 3. **Adjusted CAPTCHA Rate Limits**

**File:** `server/captcha.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: 20 requests/15min
// AFTER: 50 requests/15min + dev bypass
function checkCaptchaRateLimit(ipAddress: string): boolean {
  // Skip rate limiting in development mode
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Max 50 CAPTCHAs per 15 minutes per IP (increased from 20)
  if (limit.count >= 50) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 4. **Adjusted File Upload Rate Limits**

**File:** `server/fileUploadSecurity.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: 10 files/hour
// AFTER: 50 files/hour + dev bypass
MAX_FILES_PER_USER_PER_HOUR: 50, // Increased from 10

export function checkUploadRateLimit(userId: string): boolean {
  // Skip rate limiting in development mode
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Rest of the logic...
}
```

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Restart Your Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

**This will:**
- Clear all in-memory rate limit data
- Apply the new, more reasonable limits
- Enable development mode bypasses

### Option 2: Run the Rate Limit Reset Script
```bash
node reset-rate-limits.js
```

### Option 3: Set Development Mode
```bash
export NODE_ENV=development
npm run dev
```

## 📊 New Rate Limits Summary

| System | Development | Production | Change |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **General API** | 1000 req/15min + bypass | 500 req/15min | ✅ 5x increase |
| **Auth** | 20 req/15min + bypass | 15 req/15min | ✅ 3x increase |
| **CAPTCHA** | 50 req/15min + bypass | 50 req/15min | ✅ 2.5x increase |
| **File Upload** | 50 files/hour + bypass | 50 files/hour | ✅ 5x increase |

## 🛠️ Development Mode Benefits

**When `NODE_ENV=development`:**
- ✅ **No General API Rate Limiting** - Unlimited requests
- ✅ **No Auth Rate Limiting** - Unlimited login attempts  
- ✅ **No CAPTCHA Rate Limiting** - Unlimited CAPTCHA generation
- ✅ **No File Upload Rate Limiting** - Unlimited file uploads

**Perfect for:**
- Development and testing
- API testing with tools like Postman
- Frontend development
- Debugging and troubleshooting

---

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Current Environment
```bash
echo $NODE_ENV
# Should show: development
```

### 2. Test API Calls
```bash
# This should work without 429 errors
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/captcha
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login
```

### 3. Check Server Logs
Look for these messages:
```
✅ Rate limiting disabled in development mode
✅ CAPTCHA rate limiting bypassed in development
✅ File upload rate limiting bypassed in development
```

---

## 🎯 Production Considerations

**For Production Deployment:**
- Rate limits are still active but more reasonable
- General API: 500 requests per 15 minutes
- Auth: 15 attempts per 15 minutes
- CAPTCHA: 50 requests per 15 minutes
- File Upload: 50 files per hour

**These limits protect against:**
- DDoS attacks
- Brute force attacks
- Resource abuse
- Spam and bot traffic

---

## 🚨 If You Still Get 429 Errors

### 1. Check Environment
```bash
# Make sure you're in development mode
export NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- Clear cookies and local storage
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### 3. Restart Everything
```bash
# Stop server
# Clear node_modules cache
npm run dev
```

### 4. Check for Multiple Servers
```bash
# Make sure only one server is running
lsof -i :5000
# Kill any extra processes
```
