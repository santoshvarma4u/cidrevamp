# Docker Development Stage Fix

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
```
failed to solve: target stage "development" could not be found
```

### **Root Cause:**
The Dockerfile only had `builder` and `production` stages, but Docker Compose was trying to use a `development` stage that didn't exist.

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Added Development Stage to Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
# Development stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS development

# Install runtime dependencies for canvas and other native modules
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    python3 py3-pip make g++ \
    cairo-dev jpeg-dev pango-dev musl-dev \
    giflib-dev pixman-dev pangomm-dev \
    libjpeg-turbo-dev freetype-dev

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Set Python path for node-gyp
ENV PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
RUN npm ci

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Create required directories
RUN mkdir -p uploads logs/reports

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "const http = require('http'); \
  http.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health', (res) => { \
    process.exit(res.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1); \
  }).on('error', () => process.exit(1));"

# Start the application in development mode
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### **2. Enhanced Docker Compose for Development**
```yaml
volumes:
  - app_uploads:/app/uploads
  - app_logs:/app/logs
  - .:/app                    # Mount source code for hot reload
  - /app/node_modules         # Preserve node_modules
```

---

## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT FEATURES**

### **Development Stage Benefits:**
- ✅ **Hot Reload** - Source code mounted for live updates
- ✅ **Dev Dependencies** - All development tools included
- ✅ **Debug Mode** - Enhanced logging and debugging
- ✅ **Fast Startup** - No build step required
- ✅ **Volume Mounts** - Live code changes reflected immediately

### **Available Stages:**
1. **`builder`** - Builds the application
2. **`development`** - Development mode with hot reload
3. **`production`** - Optimized production build

---

## 📋 **USAGE**

### **Start Development:**
```bash
# Build and start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Rebuild if needed
docker-compose build app
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Development URLs:**
- **Main App**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:5000/admin`
- **API Health**: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

---

## 🔄 **HOT RELOAD**

The development stage includes:
- **Source Code Mounting** - Changes to your code are immediately reflected
- **Node Modules Preservation** - Dependencies are preserved in container
- **Log Streaming** - Real-time log output for debugging
- **Health Monitoring** - Automatic health checks

---

**Status:** ✅ DEVELOPMENT STAGE ADDED  
**Next Step:** Run `docker-compose up -d` to start development environment  
**Hot Reload:** ✅ ENABLED

Your Docker development environment is now ready! 🛠️
