# Cleartext Password Submission Fix

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Cleartext Submission of Password  
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

---

## Problem Identified

Passwords were being submitted over HTTP connections, allowing cleartext transmission that could be intercepted by attackers.

### Security Risk
- Passwords transmitted in plain text over HTTP
- Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
- Credential theft via network sniffing
- Compliance violation (security standards)

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side HTTPS Enforcement (`server/security.ts`)

**New Middleware:** `enforceHttpsForAuth()`

```typescript
export function enforceHttpsForAuth(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // Only check authentication endpoints
  const isAuthEndpoint = [
    '/api/login',
    '/api/auth/login',
    '/api/register'
  ].includes(req.path);
  
  if (!isAuthEndpoint) {
    return next();
  }
  
  // Check if request is over HTTPS
  const isHttps = 
    req.secure || 
    req.protocol === 'https' || 
    req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] === 'https' ||
    (req.headers['x-forwarded-ssl'] === 'on') ||
    (req.headers['x-forwarded-port'] === '443');
  
  // Block HTTP unless explicitly allowed for development
  if (!isHttps && !(allowHttpSessions && isDevelopment)) {
    // Returns 400 error with clear message
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      message: 'Security Error: Passwords must be submitted over HTTPS',
      error: 'CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_BLOCKED',
      code: 'HTTPS_REQUIRED'
    });
  }
  
  next();
}
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Blocks HTTP requests to `/api/login`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/register`
- âœ… Checks multiple HTTPS indicators (protocol, secure flag, proxy headers)
- âœ… Returns clear error message (400 Bad Request)
- âœ… Logs blocked attempts as CRITICAL security events
- âœ… Allows HTTP only in development if `ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS=true`

### 2. Client-Side Protection (`client/src/pages/admin/auth.tsx`)

**Protocol Check Before Submission:**

```typescript
// Security: Check if we're on HTTP and warn/prevent password submission
if (window.location.protocol === 'http:' && 
    window.location.hostname !== 'localhost' && 
    window.location.hostname !== '127.0.0.1') {
  throw new Error('Security Error: Passwords must be submitted over HTTPS. Please use HTTPS to login.');
}
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Prevents password submission over HTTP (except localhost)
- âœ… Shows clear error message to user
- âœ… Client-side validation before request

### 3. Middleware Integration

**Applied in both development and production:**

- `server/index.ts` - Development server
- `server/index.prod.ts` - Production server

**Position:** Before login routes are registered

---

## Testing

### Test 1: HTTP Login Blocked (Production)

```bash
# In production mode (NODE_ENV=production, ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS=false)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Security Error: Passwords must be submitted over HTTPS",
  "error": "CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_BLOCKED",
  "details": "This endpoint requires a secure HTTPS connection. Please use HTTPS to submit passwords.",
  "code": "HTTPS_REQUIRED"
}
```

**HTTP Status:** `400 Bad Request`

---

### Test 2: HTTPS Login Works

```bash
# Over HTTPS (should succeed)
curl -X POST https://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin","captchaSessionId":"test","captchaInput":"dev"}' \
  -k
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "...",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**HTTP Status:** `200 OK`

---

### Test 3: Development Mode (HTTP Allowed)

```bash
# In development mode with ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS=true
NODE_ENV=development ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS=true npm run dev

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin","captchaSessionId":"test","captchaInput":"dev"}'
```

**Expected:** âœ… Login succeeds (development only)

---

### Test 4: Register Endpoint Protection

```bash
# Test registration endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"test","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Expected Response:** Same 400 error as login

---

## Security Benefits

### âœ… Complete Protection
- **Server-Side Blocking:** HTTP requests automatically rejected
- **Client-Side Validation:** Prevents submission before request
- **Clear Error Messages:** Users know to use HTTPS
- **Security Logging:** All attempts logged as CRITICAL events

### âœ… Compliance
- **OWASP Guidelines:** Passwords must be encrypted in transit
- **NIST Standards:** TLS required for authentication
- **PCI-DSS:** Encrypted transmission of credentials
- **GDPR:** Security of personal data

### âœ… Attack Prevention
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** HTTPS encryption prevents interception
- **Network Sniffing:** Cleartext passwords cannot be captured
- **Credential Theft:** Passwords encrypted during transmission
- **Eavesdropping:** TLS encryption protects data

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Production (HTTP blocked)
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS=false

# Development (HTTP allowed)
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS=true
```

### Docker Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  NODE_ENV: production
  ALLOW_HTTP_SESSIONS: "false"  # Block HTTP in production

## Security Logging

```typescript
logSecurityEvent('CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_BLOCKED', { 
  path: req.path,
  protocol: req.protocol,
  secure: req.secure,
  forwardedProto: req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'],
  ip: req.ip,
  message: 'HTTP request blocked - passwords must be submitted over HTTPS'
}, req, 'CRITICAL');
```

**Monitor blocked attempts:**
```bash
docker logs cid-app | grep "CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_BLOCKED"
```
